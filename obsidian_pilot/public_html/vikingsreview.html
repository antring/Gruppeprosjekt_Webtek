                                The TV Series Vikings is History Channel's first attempt 
                                to produce its own historical drama. And it should be said 
                                that to be the first of its kind, it is invested heavily 
                                and ambitious with this series. Michael Hirst (The Tudors, Elizabeth) 
                                writes and produces the series, and on the cast we find strong 
                                actors like George Blagden (Les Misérables, Wrath of the Titans) 
                                and Sweden's big son Gustaf Skarsgård (The Way Back, Kon-Tiki, Evil). 
                                They are, however, placed in the shade of largely unknown Travis Fimmel, 
                                who plays the show's lead role.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Vikings takes place in the beginning of the Viking Age, 
                                around the start of the ninth century. The series' protagonist, 
                                Ragnar Lodbrok (Travis Fimmel), lives a simple life as a
                                farmer with his wife Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick) 
                                and their two children, Bjorn (Nathan O'Toole) and Gyda (Ruby O'Leary). 
                                The family has sweared fealty to the local Earl, Earl 
                                Haraldsson (Gabriel Byrne), a simple man with small visions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every year the men of Earl Haraldson set out to plunder 
                                in the east. Those who are victims of the looting are usually poor 
                                farmers and fishermen, and raids end up with lean yield. 
                                Ragnar, however, has heard rumors of a country in the south with large 
                                riches. He has also found a way to navigate the ocean, 
                                and challenges Earl Haraldson to let the men go 
                                raid in the west.

                            <p>
                                As expected of a series produced by 
                                History Channel there has been placed great emphasis 
                                on historical realism. It has been taken 
                                som eliberty to increase the tension 
                                in the series, but I do not see this as 
                                negative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Several of the characters in the series are based on real 
                                people from the Viking Age, or taken from the sagas 
                                and Norse Edda. Ragnar Lodbrok was a legendary 
                                Norwegian earl who is supposed to have been the greatest threat 
                                against England and France in the early 800s. 
                                In the series, he has a brother named Rollo (Clive Standen), 
                                based on the Viking Hrolf Ganger, which created a 
                                Viking colony in Normandy and besieged Paris. That these 
                                two were brothers in reality seems doubtful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is also focused heavily on that the way life in the Viking Age 
                                are portrayed is realistic and free of 
                                the usual clichés we often find in other films and 
                                TV series. You will not see many horned helmets. Extra 
                                positive is the way the highlights of the series, the battle scenes, 
                                are produced. Here we get a unique insight into the way the Vikings 
                                operated in combat, and what tactics they used. Battles 
                                is usually not a chaos where everyone is running around in a field 
                                trying to chop the head of another. They are however two 
                                defined armies standing shield against shield, poking 
                                each other, while they cry Odin and Valhalla.

                                «I’m not dead yet»
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                In season 1 the acting varied between absolute 
                                brilliant and downright awful. Thankfully 
                                the bad was forgotten quickly as soon as the blood began 
                                to float again on the screen. In season one the scenes 
                                with Floki(Skarsgard) were the highlights in terms of 
                                acting. In Season 2, however, Fimmel has been the strongest, 
                                and it would appear that Vikings will be the breakthrough for his 
                                acting career. Let's hope it continues in 
                                the same track, and that the producer is able to purge all 
                                the feigned Swedish and Danish dialects.

                                    Vikings can not measure up to the epicness that is Game of Thrones. 
                                    The Vikings however, is a series that is never 
                                    boring or too lenghty. In a single episode 
                                    Ragnar can cross the Norwegian sea several times, and it is 
                                    constantly added new elements to push the story in new directions. 
                                    Because of this Vikings is a series that is always 
                                    enjoyable to watch, and each episode offers 
                                    entertainment and the occasional bloodbath.
