                                    (ObsidianPilot.com): And so it returns. Cosmos. Shunned by the Christian community and loved by childish, dreamy explorers all over the world. The documentary that unknowingly changed the course of countless human lives and became an instant scientific classic. A full three decades later, in a new, up-to-date Ship of Imagination, our host Neil deGrasse Tyson sets out to reveal the grandeur of the universe for us. Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey aims to carry on the legacy of Tysons passed mentor: famous astrotronomer, astrophysicist and scientific poet: Carl Sagan.

                                And after only four aired episodes to go by, there is no star-specked fragment of doubt: The series looks and feels amazing. Once again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sagan's rightful poetic heir is ready with his playful yet powerful tone to guide you through the entire universe known to man over the duration of this series, spanning over 13 planned episodes. 
                                <br>

                                As a long-time fan of the original Cosmos, I was scared when I first heard about the reboot. FOX also revealed that the one and only humor titan Seth McFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad) would be the producer of the show. He's not really the first person that comes to mind when you want to continue the greatest scientific program of all time, is he? Also, to make matters worse, the thought of using Cosmos to promote this years new and updated CGI and visual effects made me shiver. As with the original, imagination and a charismatic storyteller was more than enough to have anyone ponder over the universe for years to come. When I watched the first episode on the premiere night, thank the Cosmos: I couldn't be happier.  
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                For those that might be wondering: Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is not a remake of the original. It's' a continuation, and it's a worthy one. Tyson brings his own personality and his own life stories to the table, achieving exactly what Sagan did: He makes science fun. Translating hard, scientific facts into easy understandable and graphic gists is where Cosmos really shines. This show is somewhat more «alive» than its predecessor, and since it's made for a new generation, the added visual effects serves their rightful purpose, while not being overly flamboyant. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This time around the producers decided to use animated short-stories to present historical happenings, such as William Herschel discovering Uranus for the first time. And guess what? Patrick Stewart himself lends his voice to the British astronomer. You quickly develop a relationship to these «noire and sophisticated» <i>(McFarlane on inspiration for the characters)</i> animated sprites. Kara Vallow, known for working with Seth McFarlane on his animated humor-series, has no doubt done a great job making the history come to life, over three decades later.

                                The show starts out on the same, grassy, Northern California cliff that Sagan stood on 34 years ago, picking the flowers and contemplating the «awesome machinery of life». After a mildly touching story about the life and legacy of Carl Sagan, we quickly set off into the Cosmos in the Ship of Imagination, with Tyson showing the way. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We start off on Earth, explained to be merely a grain of sand in the infinitely big Cosmos, before heading out into space, being revealed our cosmis address. «We live on Earth, in the Solar System, in the Orion Arm, in the Milky Way, in the Local Group, in the Virgo Supercluster, over 100.000 light years from home, a tiny speck in the Observable Universe». From smallest to largest. Tyson loves to make us feel tiny and irrelevant as the show progress and we venture futher from home. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Over the first four episodes Tyson takes us on trips through Black Holes, to Switzerland and the quest for the Higgs Boson, stargazing for Haley's Comet, following Voyager and its incredibly long journey, and to peek through the universe through the famous Hubble Space Telescope. When he gets around to the «Cosmic Calendar», one of the most memorable parts of Sagan's Cosmos, <i>(a calendar that shows us just how insignificant a role humans play in the Universe)</i>,  the new visual effects really shines and makes it stand.
