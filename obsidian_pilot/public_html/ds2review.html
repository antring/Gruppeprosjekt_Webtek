                    There is a high probability that the first thing you hear about the Dark Souls games is how merciless and brutally hard they are. These games doesn't care about you and will do anything in their power to stop you. Even the marketing for the games hammer this point in, the subtitle for the PC version of the original Dark Souls was “Prepare to Die”. From my experiences as a veteran of the series this is a somewhat misleading impression to leave with people. These games are hard yes, but they are also fair and conquerable. They are also extremely interested with treating the player as a human being who is capable of judgment and learning from their mistakes and not as a visiting tourist in an amusement park.

                    Dark Souls II is the sequel to Dark Souls, the phenomenon that took the world by storm in 2011. The original Dark Souls was itself a spiritual successor to the cult hit Demon's Souls released in 2009. Dark Souls II is a sequel by every definition of the word. You will not find radical differences to the formula here, but small and well thought out changes that by the end will leave you with a better if not similar experience.

                    Dark Souls II, as its predecessor, is a carefully balanced hybrid between an intense hack and slash action game and a number heavy, often obfuscating RPG (Role Playing Game). Such mixing and mashing of established genres often results in a crowded mess, but in Dark Souls it really fees like there has been put a lot of thought behind it. No element feels like its weighed to heavy and the resulting experience is fresh and novel. The implications this brings to the feel of playing the game are huge. If you trust your reflexes and your skills with manipulating the controller you could complete the entire game with nary a thought to what piece of armor to wear or what kind of sword to swing at the numerous foes. On the other hand, if you are not the most skilled player, carefully assessing your situation and your character is a just as valid way to succeed.

                    The story and atmosphere of Dark Souls II is perhaps one of its most interesting facets. In Dark Souls II you play the role of a nameless character. You have been stricken by a curse and you are gradually losing your humanity. Driven by your desire to rid yourself of your curse and return to your family you find your way to the ancient and mystical land of Drangleic. Drangleic seems to have fallen from grace from its heyday. You are quickly told to seek out the king, or the former king, and that's about as much direction you will get.

                     The story by itself is not what makes it so interesting, but its the way its told, or not told. The Souls games tells its story not by long drawn out dialogues or dull cutscenes, but by the player exploring its detailed and atmospheric environments. Contrary to most games, Dark Souls II makes the storytelling and exposition part of the gameplay. And its almost all voluntary, if you are not enraptured by the tragic tale of fallen Drangleic and just want to chop down some ugly monsters the game will oblige you.

                    Dark Souls II might be one of the last big games developed for the now outdated Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, and it shows. The game often struggles to keep up with the action and the Playstation 3 version also seems to be plagued by numerous audio bugs. The Xbox 360 version runs smoother overall, but is dragged down by excessive screen tearing. Overall it is not the most beautiful or technically advanced game you will see, but it more than makes up for it in stunning art direction and immersive sound design. The land of Drangleic is huge not just in size, but in the sheer amount of different types of environments you will try to traverse. You will make your way from abandoned forests to poisonous valleys to beautiful cathedrals. When you are lost in a haunted forest with thick fog everywhere you see and the sounds of creepy laughter surrounding you, any technical problems are quickly forgotten. It should be noted that there is also an upcoming PC version of the game scheduled for release by the end of April.

                     Dark Souls II is an enormous game in multiple ways. Expect to dedicate at least 40-60 hours of your life your first time sightseeing Drangleic's various horrors and joys. There is also a large multiplayer component to the game that you are free to interact with as much or as little you desire. Dark Souls II is a very similar game to the preceding games and it's up to you to decide if this is good or bad. Sometimes it can feel a little too similar and technical issues can taint the experience for some, but most of the time it feels so single-handedly unique in a genre that is plagued by repetition.
