                                Elder Scrolls delivers what might be the MMORPG of the century.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The expectations have been sky high since the announcement of a massively multiplayer role-playing game from The Elder Scrolls (Zenimax Studios) in may 2012. 
                                With this follow-up on The Elder Scrolls franchise promises of a new revolutionary MMORPG game was made. 
                                TESO does not disappoint. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I must admit that my feelings toward this idea was mixed. 
                                The single-player RPGs of The Elder Scrolls are great games. 
                                The thought of an online version of Skyrim was tempting, but it would surely ruin the parts that makes the games so great? 
                                And I must say that Zenimax Studios and Bethesta did not disappoint at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The game is set 1000 years before the events in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. 
                                Three alliances are fighting a war against each other over supremacy in Cyrodiil. 
                                The player can choose to play on any of these three alliances.
                            </p>

                            A quick lokk at the classes available and the name of their skill lines:

                            <h2>In-game/basic storyline</h2>
                            <p>
                                Nor surprisingly, you wake up in a cell at the beginning of the game. 
                                When searching the cell a projection of a person appears by the door who calls himself "The Prophet". 
                                You learn that you are imprisoned in Coldharbour, the realm of the daedric prince Molag Bal, in a plane of Oblivion. 
                                Something that can be compared to Hell. A random escaping prisoner sets you free and you get an introduction to the game's basic mechanics. 
                                After you've gotten your introduction you meet up with Lyris Titanborn and sets out to free "The Prophet" from his cell.
                                Lyris sacrifices herself to free The Prophet. 
                                Together with him you are now able to escape back to Tamriel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When starting in Tamriel your location depends on which side you chose. 
                                The Prophet appears to you again in a projection and tells you that you got separated. 
                                While he figures things out he suggests that you explore Tamriel, get friends and make alliances in order to withstand the threat from the Daedra. 
                                From now on, what you do is your own choice.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Gameplay basics</h2>
                            <p>
                                You play TESO pretty much like the previous Elder Scrolls games. 
                                Left click to attack and right click to block. 
                                Except now you also have a bar with room for 5 spells or abilities, 1 ultimate and 1 quickbar for potions etc. 
                                Similar to the previous games you have three resources. Magica is the resource for casting spells. 
                                Health is quite obvious, run out of it and you're dead. 
                                And last: stamina for physical abilities like power attacks, weapon attacks, blocking, sprinting and sneaking. 
                            </p>
                            <img class="bigpic" src="artwork/eso/combat.png" alt="TESO combat">
                            <p>
                                Exploring, fighting and completing quests rewards experience points. 
                                Each new level grants an attribute point which you can spend on increasing your total magica, health or stamina. 
                                It also grants a skill point which brings us to the next part.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Skill lines</h2>
                            <p>
                                The team behind the game has for a long time promised that the players would be able to build their characters exactly how they want. 
                                Wheter you wanna be a sneaky rogue type healer or a heavy armor battlemage using a two hand sword, should not matter. 
                                The class you choose should not limit what weapon or armor you can use. 
                                The solution provided in TESO is actually quite good.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The class you choose provides your character with three different skill lines. 
                                Each skill line has one spell or ability ready to be unlocked at the start. 
                                If you want any of the skills further down the skill line you will need to spend one skill point to unlock the available one and place it on your bar. 
                                As you play the game the general level of the skill line will increase and more skills will become available. 
                                There are different ways of getting new skill point. One is gained each time your character levels up. 
                                Gathering 3 skyshards will grant a new skill point and some quests also reward you with a skill point upon completion. 
                                In adition there is also a skill line for the different weapon and armor types, guilds, races and craftmanships.
                            </p>
                            <img class="bigpic" src="artwork/eso/skill_line_class.png" alt="TESO class skill lines">
                            <p>
                                When a skill is unlocked and put to use the skill itself will rank up. 
                                Upon reaching rank IV the ability can be morphed. 
                                There are 2 choices, each which changes the ability's properties in different ways. 
                                A skill point is required in order to morph an ability.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Crafting</h2>
                            <p>
                                As in most other similar game you can craft your own gear in TESO.
                                The way it is done however is surprisingly different. 
                                There is no limit to what profession a character can use. 
                                The only limitation is how many skill points one is willing to use in order to craft better items. 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Blacksmithing</li>
                                <li>Clothing</li>
                                <li>Woodworking</li>
                                <li>Enchanting</li>
                                <li>Alchemy</li>
                                <li>Provisioning</li>
                            </ul>

                            Blacksmithing, clothing and woodworking pretty much works the same way. 
                            The only differences are the type crafted and the materials used.
                            Blacksmithing is for:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Weapons: axes, swords and maces both two and one hand, and daggers</li>
                                <li>Heavy armor</li>
                            </ol>
                            Clothing is for:

                            This is where you put together the item you want to create.

                            <h5>Type</h5>
                            Selects which type of armor/weapon you want to make

                            <h5>Material</h5>
                            The level of the weapon and thereby it's damage is depending on which materia is used. 
                            There are ranges where the same material is used, for instance weapon/heavy armor levels 1 â 14 uses iron ingots. 
                            How many of the given material used decides the level within the materials level range.

                            <h5>Style</h5>
                            Each of the 10 different races have each their style. 
                            It is possible to learn all the styles and craft the combination you choose.

                            <h5>Trait</h5>
                            The last one selects a trait for the item.

                            <h4>Deconstruction tab</h4>
                            As you venture through Tamriel you pick up quite a bit of stuff. 
                            Weapons and armor you no longer have use for can be deconstructed in order to get some of the materials it is made from. 
                            Rare types has a chance to give rare materials upon deconstruction.

                            <h4>Improve tab</h4>
                            The items crafted are always normal. 
                            The rarity and quality of the item is represented by a color code ranging from white(normal) to orange(legendaty). 
                            In order to improve items the proper materials are needed. 
                            The chance of successfully improving an item depends on how much of the materials are used.

                            <h4>Research tab</h4>
                            This is where you learn the traits in order to craft an item with traits. 
                            An item of same type is needed  for reaserch, which will be destroyed. 
                            If you want to craft an axe with a certain trait you will need to find an axe with that trait and research it.

                            <h3>Enchanting</h3>
                            Enchanting is a bit different than crafting gear. 
                            Enchanting is used to translate runes that are found all over Tamriel into glyphs. 
                            Glyphs are applied to weapons and armor to give them a magical property. 
                            In the beginnign all the runes are marked with question mark. 
                            First time used they give an unknown glyph, but with that you will learn the translations. 
                            Eventually when all the runes are translated you are able to create just the right glyph for yourself.

                            <img src="artwork/eso/enchanting.jpg" alt="enchanting">
                            <br>Three different types of runes together decides the properties of the glyph you are making.

                            <h3>Provisioning</h3>
                            Provisioning is used to create food and drinks. 
                            These typically gives a longer boost (35min) to either the size of your resources or regeneration rate. 
                            Unlike the others you need to find a recipie in order to learn how to make the food/drink. 
                            When a recipie is aquired simply move to a cooking fire and create the item if you have the two ingredients required.

                            <h2>Player versus Enviroment (PvE) pre 50</h2>
                            <h3>Solo</h3>
                            After the game introduction you are free to move around Tamriel. Pick up and do any quest you like.
                            Most of the quest are found only by exploring. Quite often you find an NPC outside a dungeon who needs you to
                            help him/her. Otherwise there are quests from main story, guilds and zone main story. These are progressive.

                            <img class="bigpic" src="artwork/eso/conversation.png" alt="conversation">

                            <h3>Group</h3>
                            Most of the quests can be done with a group. Ususlly only main story and guild quest sends you on solo missions.
                            There are also group dungeons with a higher difficulty which require a group to clear. These typically have
                            better rewards.

                            <h2>Player versus Player (PvP)</h2>
                            Right in the middle of Tamriel lies Cyrodiil. This huge area is where the three alliances fight each other.
                            And this area really is huge. Upon reaching level 10 you can choose a pvp server to join and then teleport to Cyrodiil.
                            The area consist of a large amount of keeps which can be captured by any of the three alliances.
                            Like other places in Tamriel this place also has dungeons, skyshards, quests and so forth.

                            <h3>Solo/duo pvp</h3>
                            Roam alone or with a friend. Complete quest, gather resources and hunt enemy players. By moving in to
                            enemy territory there is a high risk of meeting bigger groups of enemies.

                            <h3>Group PvP/"Gank Squads"</h3>
                            Move around in groups of 3-4 players. Basically the same as solo/duo but with more manpower to do real damage
                            to enemies and increase your chances of survival.

                            <h3>Huge battles</h3>
                            Quite often huge groups gather up to siege enemy keeps. Take over resources around the keeps and destroy the walls
                            with siege weapons like ballistas, trebuches and catapults. When the keep is captured you need to rebuild the wall
                            you destroyed on your way in in order to keep the enemy from recapturing easily.
                            <h2>Summary</h2>

                                    The game has interesting quests and good story, but it doesn't have quite as good a solution as we have
                                    seen in for instance Star Wars: The Old Republic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The combat system is good, more challenging and exiting than the old "lock-on" style. However, some times the combat seems slow and non-responsive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Good graphics and exiting landscapes makes it fun to explore the game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When completing quests you actually feel like you have helped. If you return to the area where you helped a town
                                    under attack for instance, the town is no longer under attack and the NPCs recognizes your effort.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The PvP is epic and it actually feels like you are doing somehting useful, however, sometime the distances get
                                    to big and you loose interest. 
                                </p>
