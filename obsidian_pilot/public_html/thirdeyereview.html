                                The third eye is a Norwegian crime show, with Kyrre Haugen Sydness in the lead role as police detective Viggo Lust. Four years ago a nightmare for any parent happened to Viggo, his five-year-old daughter Christina vanished outside a shop, when Viggo were inside buying ice cream for his daughter. 
                                There were no witnesses and nobody had seen anything, he were in the shop for only a minute, and still his daughter vanished from here seat in the bicycle.

                                When Viggo sleeps, Christina comes to him in his dreams and give clues and tips to help him solve cases and to find here. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the series, each episode is about the main plot, but there is always a new case that gets solved in each episode. Kyrre plays very convincing as the grieving father who is always on the hunt to find out what happened to his daughter. 
                                His marriage ended and he lives alone in the family house, his wife has a new man in her life. The police case for Christina is dropped because of no progresses in the case, but Viggo never gives up on finding the truth about what happened to his daughter.
                                You can see a man struggling to come over the fact that his daughter is gone, he is mentally exhausted and teard down. Mari Friis played by Ida Elise Broch becomes the partner to Viggo, her acting is a bit nervous and uncertain in the start of the series, nevertheless as the show goes on you can see that her acting is improving gradually throughout the series. Another co-worker in the force is Detective Due played by Ingar Helge Gimle seems very convincing as the older detective with experience and calmness.

                                One of the better modern Norwegian crime series
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The series seems to be one of the better modern Norwegian crime series that are made , my first thought that struck me right before I was about to watch the first episode a night I couldn’t sleep was that this show was going to disappoint me with no doubt.
                                However, I continued to watch the other episodes that came out on Sumo, and I was interested and wanted to find out more. But the first thing that caught my interest in the series, is what happened to Christina? It made me want to continue watching the show, and be a part of the journey.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The script seems a bit lightweight written, one can often interpret what is going to happen in the episode cases, it’s too easy to solve the case before even the characters solves the case. 
                                Here the director and screenwriter could have done a better job. 
                                The solutions to the episode cases should have been more difficult to solve, not every episode is easy to solve.
                            </p>

                                The episodes are very good, varied cutting, and edited, especially the scenes that are sad and action scenes where viggo and his partner hunt criminals. 
                                In the dreams where Christina gives clues, they are nice edited, and gives the watcher an excitement, and a spooky feeling.

                                    Four years ago a nightmare for any parent happened to Detective Viggo Lust, his five-year-old daughter Christina vanished outside a shop, when Viggo were inside buying ice cream for his daughter. There were no witnesses and nobody had seen anything, he were in the shop for only a minute, and still his daughter vanished from here seat in the bicycle.
                                    The series builds up fine, but with some small jumps at times, the main plot is the disappearance of her daughter and there is an episode plot in every episode that gets solved. The episode plots can be a little easy to solve for yourself before the characters have even solved them. The acting in the show is a bit varied, but the lead role character plays very convincing as the grieving father who is always on the hunt to find out what happened to his daughter. One can see that it is draining him of energy and that it affects him mentally. The third eye is one of the better modern Norwegian crime series that have been made , but note the word Norwegian, the show cannot be compared with U.S. crime series like True Detective, etc., they are on a whole other level.
