                                A Disney movie, containing song, dancing, happiness and sorrow with a dash of love. Seems familiar? So do we.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When a sorcery spell conjures a kingdom into eternal winter, the fearless optimist Anna decide to embark on an epic journey to find her sister Elsa, the Snow Queen who against her will with her magic powers have laid her kingdom in winter hibernation. Along with snowman Olaf, the reindeer Svein and the mountainman Kristoffer, they're going on a journey through forests and mountains to make summer return.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Walt Disney Animation has gained much attention for this film, especially here in Norway since the film in many ways seems to be based on norwegian culture. Many items of that nature, stave church, northern lights, reindeer and more can obviously be reasons for this. Charming is it anyway, Frozen is nowhere near as icy as the title would suggest.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In classic Disney spirit it's obviously warmhearted morality in the bottom of the story, and the end could melt cold winter hearts worldwide. The characters are also classically funny and stereotypical, though in this Disney context, it is almost as if this is charming, more than annoying. Traditions may therefore come as a movie to good, something Disney and their movies are often an excellent example.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Elements as prince and princess, their major obstacle to their love, the ugly and evil opponent (at least) a comedic character, and a bunch other ingredients are therefore most present in "Frost". Also the classic rants Disney ballads are well represented here, and the music is magnificent. Simple songs are also very catchy, something far from always in children's and family films. As such works increadibly film almost like a musical in itself.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, the most important from a cinematic point of view is, and always will in an animation, becoming just the visual appeal of your animation. "Frost" is insanely pretty as such! Even though it is a lot of white and bright due to winter landscape, then perhaps therefore more bombastic colors and gorgeous when they first occur. The largely pink, purple, blue and turquoise color palette will have both girls and boys to be sugar high and excited, guaranteed. The entire production is so thorough and eyecandy that one can hardly help being carried away, even as an adult. The ability to pull out the child in us is something that should characterize a good family film, and Disney is like the king of the capacity, still. 3D format can also raise the visual further and add enough a neat dimension.

                                    This beautiful film is something that reminds us of the good old Disney classics. So a viewing should seriously be considered, if just only to reminisce about the good old movies.
