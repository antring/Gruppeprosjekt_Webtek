                                If you one day got the chance to turn back time, 
                                and relive your life. The ability to change things, 
                                focus on other goals, maybe go a different direction in a 
                                important decision. Would you do it? Or would you 
                                let things remain as they are, and not try to change anything?

                                Such feels

                            <p>
                                It is over two years since I picked up To the Moon the first time.
                                Voluntary it was not. I was almost forced by a friend to 
                                play through it, as it apparently was be the best game ever.
                                Reluctantly I got right in front of the computer screen, and nothing
                                could have prepared me for what was to come. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To report this little game is difficult, since I'm afraid to 
                                reveal too much. What I can say, and also show 
                                in the trailer, is that the game is about an old man named Johnny,
                                and the setting is a bit into the future. Johnny is on his deathbed,
                                and has contacted Sigmund Corp.. to fulfill one last wish. Sigmund Corp.. 
                                delivers a rather unique service. They can tap into the mind of a person, 
                                and plant small seeds in classical inception style that will change the 
                                persons memories of his life.
                            </p>

                                <img src="artwork/ttm_img2.jpg" alt="Lagertha">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The Job assignment falls on Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene,
                                and it is these two characters you switch between playing as. They arrive
                                at the house of Johnny, set up the necessary equipment, and 
                                get ready to jump into hs mind and change his memories. 
                                The only problem is that the Johnyys desire is quite diffuse. 
                                He wants to travel to the moon but cannot remember why. Anyway, a
                                job is a job, and Neil and Eva jump in with their heads held high.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The seeds that will change the memories of Johnny have to be 
                                planted as early as possible in his life, that is, in the oldest
                                memories. The problem is that these memories can not be reached 
                                immediately. Neil and Eva have to work backwards, and jump from 
                                one memory to the next. This means that the story is told backwards,
                                and it works brilliantly.
                            </p>

                                STOP!
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                I decide to stop saying anything more about the story here,
                                so that I don't spoil the experience for others. It takes about
                                five hours to complete the game, but much longer to digest the 
                                story being told. Maybe you now think the same as I thought, 
                                that this is impossible a game for me. I still strongly recommend
                                you to give this game a try.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The graphics may be very simple, and the same can be said about 
                                the game mechanics, but it means nothing for this game. 
                                The entire focus is on the history, and when you got a 
                                story that is this good, everything else is forgotten immediately.
                                In addition, the game has an incredible piano soundtrack, 
                                which can make the toughest alpha male sensitive and vulnerable.

                                    Games like The Last of Us and The Walking Dead has been praised 
                                    for their stories and emotional moments. To the Moon deserves
                                    a place on the same shelf as these heavyweights, and is further
                                    proof that games, like books and movies, is a wonderful medium 
                                    to tell a story.
