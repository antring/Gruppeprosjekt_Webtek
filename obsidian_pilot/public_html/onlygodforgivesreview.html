                                Only God Forgives is not a film for everyone. This is a film where the main character only has around 17 lines of dialogue, where long stretches of time goes by with nothing happening all accompanied by a cynical and brutal atmosphere that's not for the faint of heart. And I almost love it. 
                            </p>

                                Only God Forgives is the latest film by Danish director/auteur Nicolas Winding Refn and it stars Ryan Gosling as the main character. Because of these two factors one could be quick to assume that it would be similar to the director's last film, Drive, also starring Ryan Gosling. The similarities are there for sure, but this film is its own beast, not relying on Drive's success with the general public. The film is significantly more artistic and ethereal, relying heavily on symbolism and hidden themes instead of a straightforward plot.

                                Julian, played by an intensely quiet Ryan Gosling, is a drug trafficker in Bangkok, Thailand along with his brother. In the first few minutes of the film, Julian's brother rapes and murders an underage prostitute and ends up getting killed by police approved revenge. This brutal opening quickly sets the tone and let you know what kind of film you are about to experience. The rest of the film is about Julian' s quest for revenging the death of his brother, pushed on by his tyrannical mother. Julian himself seems apathetic to the whole situation and spends most of the film staring at his hands, getting beat up or fantasizing about his mother. There is also a subplot about a corrupt police lieutenant, played by Thailand local Vithaya Pansringarm, who provides the most memorable role in the film.

                                What the film lacks in plot and characterization it makes up for in astoundingly beautiful cinematography, a gritty and murky atmosphere and a dreamlike sense of reality. The music is sparse, but effective with twisted montages and well placed karaoke sessions. The neon infested night time scenes of Bangkok's thriving underworld really help sell Julian's descent to darkness.

                                    Only God Forgive is a strange film. The characters all feel like a metaphor waiting to be explored, with only a few characteristics defining their personalities. And if you can look behind the juvenile dialogue you might be able to interact with some of the abstract philosophical themes that definitely are hidden in there. For some it might just be an unflinchingly violent simple tale of revenge, but for others it might be exceedingly beautiful in its depth if you look behind the surface level. Or it might just be somewhere in between.
