                                Rush is based on the true story that took place in the 1970s in formula 1 racing, were we follow the real-life rivalry between formula one racing legends James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. The film begins in the early careers of both racers and builds the rivalry up to the World championship formel1 in 1976.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                James Hunt played by Chris Hemsworth is a womanizer and live life without obstacles and consequences. James has his motto sewn on his racing suite, Sex- The breakfast of Champions. Nikki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl is the serious one and have no social skills, and he is driving with a maximum limit of 30 % risk, he is a focused driver who does not have plans to get friends in this sport, and he`s being accused to have bought himself inside formula 1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The details in the film match very well the time-period, you got the same cars, sponsors and other little details that is perfect, formula1 is a sponsor driven sport, and you can see that very well in the film.
                            </p>    
                            <p>
                                The performances of both main actors seems very good , especially Daniel Bruhl plays very convincing in his role as the distinctive asocial concentrated Nikki Lauda, and Chris Hemsworth as a womanizer and enjoying life. The play seems genuine and rivalry comes well presented in the play. One can smell a hint of a friendship in the film even if they are rivals. The relationship between Hunt and Lauda is very functioning that helps the film giving the story a greater depth and credibility.
                                Some parts of the film is a bit predictable , especially when it comes to conversations between Hunt and Lauda, and in the middle of the film there are some time jumps , but the movie is without doubt entertaining and it reflects well the dangerous sport of Formula 1 at this time . This is one of the few car movies, which actually have managed to make a good story without destroying it. Its racing scenes are thrilling, and the personal dynamics on track and of the track are genuinely intriguing, this formula one story is not just for petrol heads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The editing in the film is well done and the different angles and slow motion on the track is perfectly done, and not to mention the audio of the engines and tires. The result of this is the viewer gets a rush watching the movie, and gives it a more real feeling.
