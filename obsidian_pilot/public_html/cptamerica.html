                                Captain America is back in one of the better Marvel movies in a long time.

                                Cpt. Steve Rogers is struggling to adapt to the modern society. 
                                He was after all a super soldier created during the 2nd World War to represent America and what they stood for. 
                                He was an image of loyalty, honesty and fought for freedom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nick J. Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who was responsible for bringing the hero back after being frozen 
                                in the ice since the plane crash in an arctic area, has incorporated cpt. Rogers in his organization. 
                                When Fury himself is attacked by an unknown enemy he seeks Rogers' help. Fury tells him that SHIELD has been compromised right before he gets shot three times. 
                                With what seems to be his last words, Fury tells Rogers that he cannot trust anyone and gives him a flash drive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With no idea who to trust Captain America fights this new unknown enemy. 
                                We follow Cpt. Rogers through action filled chase scenes and intense fights, armed with only his shield and fists.
                                It eventually appears that Hydra did not die with Red Skull, but slowly grew within S.H.I.E.L.D. and threatens to take over the world with a new master plan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some of the amazing things with Captain America are the fights. 
                                They are somewhat more realistic, and not completely ruled by CGI, but have more of the raw good old fistfights between hero and villain.
