                                A goat hellbent on destruction is coming to a computer near you!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Goat Simulator. The game internet could not live without. The game that started it's life as a gamejam for the swedish game developer Coffee Stain Studios, is now one of the most popular games this far in 2014. 
                                In a games industy taking itself very seriously, Goat Simulator is a refreshing change to the outright silly and hilarious.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's a joke of a game. Small, silly, buggy as hell and simple design. It's a physics game destined to make you laugh if you posess any humour at all. There's not much actual gameplay beyond breaking things for points, points that does not really matter or can be used for anything. However the score is probably the least of you worries in this game. You don't care about the points. You will care how you can make that poor goat make do stupid things to make you laugh even more! 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Goat Simulator has no story to explain why the goat has such hatred for the world and is hellbent on destroying it. There are however mission objectives, or quests if you like. That one can complete for no reward at all other than a mental thumbs up. Challenges as stay airborne for 18 seconds, kick an object 250 meters and collect sacrifices for an evil pentagram is only a few examples to wet your appetite. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The most important part of the game, as said by the developers themselves. Much of the sillyness in the game is a result of the buggy and glitchy nature of the game. They have said they will not patch anything that is not gamebreaking. Yours truly did however manage to make the game crash at several occasions. So it's far from perfect, but truly perfect from afar.

                                    Now, the most important question remains, and that dear reader is for you. Why are you still reading this review? Get on Steam and buy it! Goat out into the world and share the laugh!
                                    Clearly this is a worthy candidate for game of the year 2014. Since the year not yet has passed, the verdict have to wait. But if you want to have a laugh and most important of all. Lick a passing hangglider as a goat. This is the game for you! And of course, the game is exclusive to the PC gaming masterrace!
